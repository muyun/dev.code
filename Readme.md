* how computers interpret computer programs and carry out computational processes  
* some recent progress in computer programs  

* 现在的编程工作更多是调用和组合别人写的轮子，而不像以前那样需要对轮子如何抽象和实现理解得很清楚 



#### vim
* common commands 
    - :sp (:split) -> split vim the window horizontally  
    - :vsp (:vsplit) -> split vim window vertically  
    - Ctrl + wj -> move cursor to the window below (horizontal split)  
    - Ctrl + wk -> move cursor to the window below (horizontal split)  
    - Ctrl + wh -> move cursor to the left window (vertical split)
    - Ctrl + wl -> move cursor to the right window (vertical split)


#### Python  
* Python provides **a kind of "domain language" for thinking about your problem**    
    - **Python Data Model**, and its API to make our own objects  
        + **The built-in operators and expressions are at the core** of that language and everything else builds from it.  

        + we leverage the Python Data Model to build new classes  
            - implement special methods when we want out objects to support and interact with fundamental language constructs  
            - the Python interpreter **invokes special methods to perform** basic object operations  
  
    - one you build **a kind of intuition around python's built-in objects and operations**, you will find that your intuition applies everywhere  
        
* Object, and Protocols  
    - everything in Python is first-class  
    - **All objects can be treated as data**
