 - Class1.py is an oop instance  
 - ** Inheritance.py is an Inheritance exercise  **  
 - ** LinkedList.py is the linked list  **  

* C++ (in Thinking in C++) 
 - vector.cpp is an vector syntax exercise  
 - vector1.cpp is another vector syntax exercise  
 - trString.cpp is about string implements in Class  
 - trCplus.cpp is about pointer array and array pointer  
 - swap.cpp includes strcpy implements and some other exercises like vector  
 - string.cpp is an string syntax exercise  
 - static.cpp is the static function exercise  
 - pointer.cpp is the array and pointer exercise  
 - odd.cpp computers all odd num giving a range  
 - codeTrain.cpp is a class syntax exercise in c++  
 - basic.cpp gives the const, reference, typedef, enum exercise in c++  
 - VectorCopy.cpp copys the elements in list to deque vector, is a STL exercise  
 - Stash2.h, Stash2.cpp, Stash2Test.cpp and PStash.h, PStash.cpp, PStashTest give the good code exemple  
 - ** Reference.cpp gives the reference and pointer review  **
