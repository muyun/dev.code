* Python
 - utils/ define the basic data structure
 - exercise/ is some code exercises in python

* notes 
 - Data structure 
    + sequences of sequences -> (string, list, tuple)  
      string, and tuple are immutable
      
      => list of characters(mutable) 
         use a sequence (the tuple or string) as a dic key 
         pass a sequence as an arg -> use tuple reduce the potential for unexpected behavior due to aliasing
