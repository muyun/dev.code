2) Class1.py is an oop instance
3) Inheritance.py is an Inheritance exercise  ***
4) LinkedList.py is the linked list  ***

C++:
1) vector.cpp is an vector syntax exercise
2) vector1.cpp is another vector syntax exercise
3) trString.cpp is about string implements in Class
4) trCplus.cpp is about pointer array and array pointer
5) swap.cpp includes strcpy implements and some other exercises like vector
6) string.cpp is an string syntax exercise
7) static.cpp is the static function exercise
8) pointer.cpp is the array and pointer exercise
9) odd.cpp computers all odd num giving a range
10) codeTrain.cpp is a class syntax exercise in c++
11) basic.cpp gives the const, reference, typedef, enum exercise in c++
12) VectorCopy.cpp copys the elements in list to deque vector, is a STL exercise
13) Stash2.h, Stash2.cpp, Stash2Test.cpp and PStash.h, PStash.cpp, PStashTest give the good code exemple
14) Reference.cpp gives the reference and pointer review  ***
15) Inheritance.cpp gives an inheritance instance in c++
16) GuessNum.cpp is a google homework, which is a guessign game where the player guesses the secret number
17) GetFilesData.h, GetFilesData.cpp, GetFilesDataTest.cpp is the project of distributed system   ***
18) Function.cpp is the function review, including pointer parameters, reference parameters in function
19) FriendFunction.cpp reviews the friend function in c++
20) Erase.cpp reviews the erase function in STL
21) ConstPointers.cpp reviews the pointer to const and const pointer
22) ConstMember.cpp reviews Const function in Class
23) Class.cpp reviews the class syntax in c++, including constructor initializer, default constructor, friend function, copy constructor and destructor  ****
24) Class1.cpp is a good example to understand default constructor, copy constructor, destructor  *****
25) Class2.cpp reviews pointer members in c++   ****
26) Class3.cpp includes virtual and protected member in class, dynamic binding,public, private and protected inheritance, derived to base conversions, derived constructors and copy control , copy constructors concept   *****
27) BookRecorded.cpp is vector and string exercise
28) AssociativeContainer.cpp is about associative container review 

Others:
1) subsCounter.pl compute numbers of subscriber, which was done in Alcatel-Lucent  **
2) create_patch.tcl, dbmig_gen.pl, gen_patch.pl, gen_patchLoad.pl, gen_patchStr2.pl, patchLoad.sh are the patch tool, which was done in Alcatel-Lucent
3) localService.lua displays all users's location based on users' location on screen, based on Corona middle layer
